# AngularJS Touch Carousel

This is a simple carousel implementation for AngularJS ng-repeats.

For best performances on mobile devices, it uses CSS 3D transforms (GPU accel).

It handles click and touch events and runs only on webkit at the moment.

Comments and contributions welcome :)

Proudly brought to you by the [@revolunet](http://twitter.com/revolunet) team.

## Usage :

Add a dependency to `angular-carousel` module in your application.

Then, just add a `carousel` attribute to your `<ul>` block and your `<li>`'s become swipable ;)

```html
<h3>Discover sports</h3>
<ul carousel class="image">
  <li ng-repeat="image in sportImages" style="background-image:url({{ image }});">
    <div class="layer">{{ image }}</div>
  </li>
</ul>
```

Of course, include `angular-carousel.js` and `angular-carousel.css` in your project.

## Todo :
 - ~~Grunt build~~
 - more tests :)
 - cancel swipe if too short
 - indicator
 - optional auto-slide
 - buffer slides (3) to reduce DOM size and allow dynamic add/remove of slides (inifinite scroll)
